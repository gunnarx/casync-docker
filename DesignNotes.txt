Design Notes
------------

Just some comment on the choice of base image. I basically just want a
small base image for this...

For really good casync support and newest version it would seem that a
RedHat distro would be the logical choice (and I often use Fedora on a
day-to-day basis).  I'd be happy to switch if I could get a really minimal
image.

But for now, it's using Ubuntu since it's much smaller compared to the
standard Fedora I tried. Some other base distros I tried didn't have casync
available, or at least not easy to find.

Now for my personal use I often have Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian layers
downloaded anyway, so the incremental size might not matter a great deal, 
but for wide usage an "application" style container should be as small
as possible, for example based on alpinelinux.
(Is casync available on alpinelinux?  Input and PRs welcome.)

Some stats:
These were just the standard base containers from Docker hub.
