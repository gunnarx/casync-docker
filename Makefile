# WORK_DIR = Work/source dir, mounted at /workdir

# OUTPUT_DIR, INPUT_DIR = optional mounts if you want to access data
# or write in another location on your host.
# These are mounted at /outputdir and /inputdir respectively.

# (In theory INPUT_DIR seems a bit superfluous since you could often just
# use WORK_DIR instead, but it might be clearer this way.  Also when
# supplying seeding directories, you might need to supply another location)

# NOTE: ALL of them default to your current working directory if not specified
